# Hello World! I'm Syed Shahid

Welcome to my blog! [cite_start]I am a passionate **BCA 2nd-year student** at **Presidency University, Bengaluru**, specializing in **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**[cite: 5, 8]. [cite_start]My journey in tech has been driven by a curiosity to solve real-world problems using innovative technologies[cite: 6].

## My Tech Stack

I love exploring different areas of software development. Over the years, I've built a strong foundation in:

- [cite_start]**Languages:** C, Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript[cite: 10].
- [cite_start]**Web Development:** Building modern apps with **Next.js**, **Node.js**, and **React**[cite: 10, 37].
- [cite_start]**AI & ML:** Working with powerful tools like **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**, and **scikit-learn**[cite: 12].

## Professional Experience

[cite_start]Currently, I am working as an **AI Chatbot Developer Intern at Nexinbe** (since Feb 2024)[cite: 15]. [cite_start]In this role, I design and deploy AI chatbots using **Voiceflow** to automate customer interactions[cite: 16]. [cite_start]It's been a great experience defining conversation flows and integrating APIs to improve user engagement[cite: 17, 18].

## Featured Projects

I believe in "learning by doing." Here are a few projects I'm particularly proud of:

### 1. Secure Vault - Password Manager
[cite_start]Built with **Next.js, Node.js, and TypeScript**, this application helps users store and manage sensitive credentials using robust encryption algorithms[cite: 20, 23]. [cite_start]I integrated a strong password generation feature to ensure security[cite: 26].

### 2. E-Learning Management System
[cite_start]A full-stack system created with **PHP and MySQL** that features Admin, Teacher, and Student roles[cite: 31, 32]. [cite_start]It handles course management, assignments, and even includes payment gateway integration[cite: 33, 34].

### 3. Snake and Ladder Game
[cite_start]Going back to the basics, I built a terminal-based game in **C** featuring dynamic board updates and dice logic[cite: 28, 29].

## What's Next?

[cite_start]I am eager to continue contributing to impactful projects and enhancing my AI/ML skills[cite: 6]. Whether it's building secure web apps or training intelligent models, I'm always ready for the next challenge.
