# Hello World! I'm Syed Shahid

Welcome to my blog! I am a passionate **BCA 2nd-year student** at **Presidency University, Bengaluru**, specializing in **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**.My journey in tech has been driven by a curiosity to solve real-world problems using innovative technologies.

## My Tech Stack

I love exploring different areas of software development. Over the years, I've built a strong foundation in:

- **Languages:** C, Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript.
- **Web Development:** Building modern apps with **Next.js**, **Node.js**, and **React**.
- **AI & ML:** Working with powerful tools like **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**, and **scikit-learn**.

## Professional Experience

Currently, I am working as an **AI Chatbot Developer Intern at Nexinbe** (since Feb 2024). In this role, I design and deploy AI chatbots using **Voiceflow** to automate customer interactions.It's been a great experience defining conversation flows and integrating APIs to improve user engagement.

## Featured Projects

I believe in "learning by doing." Here are a few projects I'm particularly proud of:

### 1. Secure Vault - Password Manager
Built with **Next.js, Node.js, and TypeScript**, this application helps users store and manage sensitive credentials using robust encryption algorithms.I integrated a strong password generation feature to ensure security.

### 2. E-Learning Management System
A full-stack system created with **PHP and MySQL** that features Admin, Teacher, and Student roles.It handles course management, assignments, and even includes payment gateway integration.

### 3. Snake and Ladder Game
Going back to the basics, I built a terminal-based game in **C** featuring dynamic board updates and dice logic.

## What's Next?

I am eager to continue contributing to impactful projects and enhancing my AI/ML skills. Whether it's building secure web apps or training intelligent models, I'm always ready for the next challenge.
